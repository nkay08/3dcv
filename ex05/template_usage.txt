There are two datasets and two separate templates python files, one for each dataset.
** The two templates are very similar. We are keeping them separate because of the different parameters **

Starter codes are given in the folowing files:
flowers.py
kitti.py

We provide helper functions to perform the following functions:
1. writing depth to image: write_depth_to_image()
2. Converting depth value to 3D: depth_to_3d()
3. Checking if a pixel is an outlier: is_outlier()
4. Ply creator from 3D points, so that you can just drop the ply file into Meshlab: ply_creator()
5. Sub_pixel cropping; for example if you want to crop a 5x5 patch centered at [4.89, 5.88]: use sub_pixel_crop()

if you have any question or feedback, just send us an email: threedcv@dfki.uni-kl.de
